# RF-Based-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning
RF-based Human Activity Recognition using Wi-Fi CSI (Internship Project)


 Summer Research Internship at BITS Pilani
 **Author:** Azad Shaikh  
 **Institute:** National Institute of Technology Raipur (ECE)  
 **Supervisor:** Dr. Sandeep Joshi  

---

## Overview
This project investigates **RF-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using
**Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)**.
Human motion alters wireless signal propagation, which can be leveraged to
classify activities such as **sitting, standing, walking, and falling**.

---

##  Code Availability Notice
The original experimental code used during the internship was not preserved.
This repository therefore focuses on:
- Complete **methodology**
- **Project workflow**
- **Pseudo-code**
- **Reproducibility guidelines**

This is common in research projects due to system dependency, NDA/IP constraints,
and hardware-specific setups.

---

##  Project Pipeline
1. CSI data collection using Intel 5300 NIC
2. MATLAB-based CSI conversion
3. Feature extraction (amplitude-domain)
4. Machine learning classification (Random Forest)
5. Performance evaluation
